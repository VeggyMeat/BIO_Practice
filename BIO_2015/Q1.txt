The Block palindrome must have an even length, as to be made up of an even number of blocks, each one has to be paired with another one,
meaning that whatever the sizes of the blocks, they are multiplied by 2, to match their pair, meaning that its the sum of even numbers which
can only sum to an even number of total word length.
For every grouping to be even, there must not be any block in the centre of the word, which does not have a pairing. This suggests that the only
way this is possible, is for there only to be TWO blocks under any circumstances, as otherwise if there were more than two, the centre two could be collapsed
into one block, leaving an odd number of blocks. That means that there can only be 2 blocks, and so only 1 grouping of them is possible.
