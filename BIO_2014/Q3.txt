3d) For the passwords to have all characters between them, one of them must start with A (the smaller one),
and that one must be the final order of that length starting with an A, so that the adjacent next one must be B. This also
means that they will have the same length, and as 36 characters are needed, both must be 18 characters long. This means that there are either
1 or none of these adjacents available. For it to be about to overun then it would need to be A then the 17 last characters of the alphabet.
This shows that when it overflows we would be left with B then the next 17 characters of the alphabet, which works without overlapping. This
means that only one of these examples exists and any others could not contain the letter A.
