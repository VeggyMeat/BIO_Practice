2b) 31
2c) 8
2d) It is not possible for Red to have scored just one more point than green, as it is impossible to score an odd number
of points in this game, due to the nature of the curving. For a closed loop the line needs to bend at least 4 times,
and needs to be an even number so that orientation of the line returns to what it was. In the same way if you want to add
any straight line sections to this, they need to be added in pairs, in order for the loop to finish itself. This means that
it is impossible for one more point to be scored, as neither side can score an odd number of points
